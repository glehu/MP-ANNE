Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network Engine

Goal of this project:
A ANN-engine providing a user friendly possibility to create and maintain a Multilayer Perceptron that can learn.

The learning process will be accomplished by updating the weights of the connections between neurons after backpropagating the error of the network's prediction.
